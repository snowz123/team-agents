Overview
This project delivers a unified AI environment with 82 specialized agents, a modern glassy interface, and a chat system that feels alive. It aims to make complex AI workflows accessible to non-experts while giving power users precise control over agent behavior, data flow, and decision traces. The system emphasizes clarity, traceability, and reliability. It is designed for industrial use cases, enterprise data environments, and research initiatives that need an orchestrated mix of automation, reasoning, and interactive conversational AI.

Why this project exists
- To provide a modular platform where AI agents can be composed to solve real-world problems.
- To offer a polished, futuristic interface that makes AI feel approachable and controllable.
- To enable teams to experiment with agent workflows, dialog patterns, and automation rules without starting from scratch.
- To support scalability, observability, and governance across a multi-agent ecosystem.

Visual identity and design
The UI uses glassmorphism-inspired visuals, soft translucency, and crisp typography to create a calm, futuristic feel. The design prioritizes clarity in user dialogs, agent status, and orchestration traces. Visuals are complemented by light animations and subtle motion to convey activity without distracting the user. Optional themes allow teams to adapt the look to their brand while preserving usability.

Core concepts
- Agent: A dedicated software unit with a specialized role. Each agent has a narrow scope, clear inputs, and defined outputs. Agents can be composed into pipelines and orchestration flows.
- Orchestrator: The central brain that coordinates agents. It handles task scheduling, dependency resolution, and conflict management.
- Context: A persistent memory layer that stores dialog history, decisions, and relevant data. Context is carried across agent calls to ensure continuity.
- Knowledge Base: A shared repository of facts, rules, constraints, and domain knowledge. It supports versioning and access controls.
- Safety and governance: Clear guardrails govern what agents can access, how they reason, and what actions they can perform. Activity is logged and auditable.
- Observability: End-to-end tracing, metrics, and logging help you understand how agents interact, where bottlenecks occur, and how decisions are made.

Agent catalog
The system ships with 82 specialized agents. They cover categories such as data ingestion, knowledge management, reasoning, planning, decision justification, user engagement, automation, integration, reporting, and compliance. Examples of agent roles:
- Data Ingestor: Pulls data from structured sources, cleans it, and stores it in the knowledge base.
- Parser: Extracts entities, intents, and relationships from text or structured data.
- Reasoner: Performs logical inference to propose hypotheses or action sets.
- Planner: Creates a step-by-step plan to achieve a goal, given constraints.
- Action Executor: Carries out concrete tasks, such as API calls, database updates, or file operations.
- Dialog Manager: Manages user conversation flow, clarifications, and context switching.
- Summarizer: Produces concise summaries of long dialog or data streams.
- Monitor: Watches for anomalies, performance issues, or policy violations.
- Compliance Auditor: Checks actions against policy and regulatory requirements.
- Translator: Converts data or dialog into different languages when needed.
- Visualizer: Converts data into charts, diagrams, or dashboards.

Each agent adheres to a standard interface, enabling plug-and-play composition. You can extend the catalog by adding new agents or customizing existing templates. The catalog is documented in the ‚ÄúAgent templates‚Äù section of this README and in the accompanying docs.

Architecture and data flow
High-level view
- The front-end UI communicates with the backend via WebSocket and REST endpoints.
- The backend hosts the Orchestrator, Agent Registry, Context Manager, Knowledge Base, and API gateways.
- Agents run as isolated components with clear boundaries to minimize cross-agent side effects.
- All actions are event-driven. The orchestrator subscribes to events, triggers agents, and aggregates results.

Component breakdown
- Front-end (UI): The user-facing interface. It renders agent statuses, dialogs, task lists, and dashboards. It uses glassmorphism aesthetics with accessible color contrast.
- Backend core:
  - Orchestrator: Schedules tasks, manages agent lifecycles, resolves dependencies, and handles retries or fallbacks.
  - Agent Registry: Keeps metadata about all agents, their capabilities, inputs, outputs, and versioning.
  - Context Manager: Maintains dialog history, user intents, and state across sessions.
  - Knowledge Base: Stores structured facts, rules, ontologies, and reference data.
  - Safety Controller: Applies permission checks, rate limits, and policy enforcement.
  - API Gateway: Exposes stable interfaces for external systems and tools.
  - Logging and Monitoring: Centralized logs, traces, and metrics for performance and auditing.
- Data and storage:
  - A relational or NoSQL store can back the knowledge base, context, and agent outputs.
  - Secrets and credentials are stored securely with access controls and rotation policies.
  - Backups and data retention policies are part of the governance framework.

Inter-agent communication
- Agents exchange structured messages in a defined schema. Messages carry a task, context, and required resources.
- The protocol emphasizes idempotence where possible to prevent duplicate work on retries.
- Outputs from agents flow into the knowledge base and are surfaced in the UI as audits and traces.

UI and user experience
- The interface balances clarity and depth. It presents agent status, task queues, and ongoing dialog in parallel.
- Contextual hints guide users on what each agent does and what data is being used.
- The UI supports multiple workspaces and roles, enabling teams to isolate experiments from production runs.
- Animations are purposeful, indicating activity without being distracting. Keyboard navigation is fully supported.

Installation and quick start
Two primary installation paths are supported: local development and containerized deployment. Both assume a modern environment with Python and standard tooling.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or newer
- npm or node for optional frontend build steps (if you extend the UI with a separate SPA)
- A database connection string or a local database setup
- Basic familiarity with terminal or shell

Local development
1. Clone the repository
   - git clone https://github.com/snowz123/team-agents.git
2. Create a virtual environment
   - python -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)
   - venv\Scripts\activate     (Windows)
3. Install dependencies
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure environment
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Edit .env to match your database, secrets, and agent settings
5. Run the server
   - export FLASK_APP=server

From the Releases page you can download pre-built artifacts suitable for quick installation or testing. The file to download is a release artifact that you will execute. The artifact contains a pre-configured environment with the backend, the agents, and the UI. Download the release artifact that fits your system from the Releases page. For explicit access to the artifact, visit the Releases page at https://github.com/snowz123/team-agents/releases. The artifact will guide you through the setup steps with a bundled installer or a ready-to-run package.

Configuration and security
Environment variables and configuration files govern the system's behavior. Keep sensitive values like secrets, API keys, and database credentials in secure storage and rotate them regularly.

Key configuration concepts
- AGENTS_CONFIG: Path or URL to the agent configuration manifest. It defines agent roles, inputs, outputs, and policies.
- DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the chosen data store. Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible NoSQL option.
- SECRET_KEY: A cryptographic secret used for session security and token signing.
- LOG_LEVEL: Controls the granularity of logs (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN).
- ENABLE_TLS: Toggle TLS support for HTTP endpoints. If you enable TLS in production, provide certificate paths and private keys.

Security best practices
- Use strong, rotated credentials for all external services.
- Enforce least privilege for agent access to data sources.
- Enable audit logging for agent decisions and user actions.
- Regularly review access controls and secrets management strategies.
- Keep dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

Development workflow
- Branching model: main for stable releases, develop for ongoing work, feature/* branches for new agents or UI features.
- Code reviews: require at least one peer review before merging to main or develop.
- CI/CD: automated tests run on push and pull requests; builds artifact for release on success.
- Documentation: keep developer docs updated, including agent templates, schemas, and API usage.

Agent templates and extending the catalog
- Each agent template defines the role, inputs, outputs, and constraints. You can copy a template, modify the parameters, and register it as a new agent variant.
- When adding a new agent:
  - Define the task and success criteria.
  - Specify allowable data sources and outputs.
  - Write tests that verify expected behavior in isolation and in orchestration.
  - Update the knowledge base with any new ontologies or references required by the agent.
- Validation and governance checks ensure new agents conform to policy constraints and data handling requirements.

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests verify individual components and agent logic.
- Integration tests simulate realistic orchestration scenarios with multiple agents running together.
- End-to-end tests exercise the user interface and dialog flows.
